Problems with petrol framework

- nextTicket Error
- asynchrousnous tests causing issues
    - decrementing counter in 1 call, takes longer than other call that increments, so ending up with an erroring test
        - mainly because its using the same component instance even though 1 is being created for eachTest (assigning it to same property - need a unique component property per test)
    - basically can only handle 1 async call per class right now
        - easiest way to fix this would be to do them synchrousnously right now. otherwise need to encaspulate the entire parent environment so the property is not shared
- no way to listen for emitted events
- this.assertEquals('The body', this.find('[name=body]').value) -> this line does not fail the test, it actually goes through

Add Ons
- would be great if it said it failed on a specific line
